The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the development of an MVP academic analytics portal. Following a detailed , the engineer prioritized setting up the core full-stack application. Key initial steps included using  to establish the FastAPI backend () and React frontend (, ), ensuring a dark UI theme matching the provided inspiration. Authentication routes and basic dashboards were implemented, followed by dependency installation () and service restarts. Comprehensive testing via  confirmed 95% functionality, validating login for both student and teacher roles and proper route access. Subsequently, a  script was created and executed to populate the database with sample course, student, teacher, enrollment, grade, assignment, and attendance data. Screenshots were taken to verify the visually impressive and data-populated student and teacher dashboards. The last interaction involved new user requests for landing page button redirection and removal of the landing page photo, which an edit was attempted for.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) academic analytics portal. It features a landing page with distinct student and teacher login options using simulated OAuth. Data ingestion is manual batch upload via Spark ETL (not yet implemented) for Enrollment CSVs and Grade JSONs, with current term data stored in PostgreSQL (though MongoDB is currently used). A Flask (now FastAPI) REST API services a React+D3.js frontend. Student page functionalities include: displaying current enrollments, weekly timetable, academic performance (SGPA, CGPA, charts, transcript download), degree progress tracking, assignment/exam info, attendance tracking, notices/calendar, faculty interaction, and resource downloads. Teacher page functionalities include: assigned courses view, teaching schedule, material upload, grade entry/analytics, attendance management, communication tools, assignment/assessment management, exam/evaluation, academic calendar, and student list/profiles. The backend uses FastAPI with REST API endpoints prefixed by , secured by simulated OAuth, and served data filtered by role. The frontend is a responsive React app with D3.js visualizations and functional filters. Security is role-based with no real student data. The MVP success hinges on fully functional student/teacher dashboards, accurate data display, intuitive visualizations, and a smooth demo. The UI was specifically requested to be dark-themed, matching an inspiration photo.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Development:** React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
- **UI/UX:** Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components, D3.js for visualizations, dark theme.
- **Authentication:** Simulated OAuth, bcrypt for password hashing.
- **Deployment:** Kubernetes container environment, Supervisor for process management.
- **Data Handling:** Data seeding, role-based access control.
- **Concurrency:** Emphasized  for scalable Python backend.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack structure:



-   **/app/backend/server.py**: This is the main FastAPI application file.
    -   **Summary of importance**: It defines the REST API endpoints for authentication (login for student/teacher), user management, and serving dashboard data. It handles user authentication, role-based access control, and interacts with the MongoDB database. It's the core of the application's business logic.
    -   **Changes made**: Initially written using  to include FastAPI app setup, CORS handling, login routes, and protected dashboard routes for students and teachers. It uses  for password hashing and likely connects to MongoDB.
-   **/app/backend/seed_data.py**: A Python script for populating the MongoDB database with sample data.
    -   **Summary of importance**: Essential for demonstrating the dashboard functionalities with meaningful data (courses, students, teachers, enrollments, grades, assignments, attendance).
    -   **Changes made**: Created during the development to inject sample data into the database for demo purposes.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React component that handles routing and renders different pages (Landing, Student Dashboard, Teacher Dashboard).
    -   **Summary of importance**: This file defines the user interface, including the landing page, login forms, and the main structure for student and teacher dashboards. It makes API calls to the backend to fetch and display data.
    -   **Changes made**: Initially written using  to set up the basic React application, incorporate routing, and implement the initial UI structure for the landing page and role-specific dashboards, adopting a dark theme. Subsequent edits were requested to modify button redirection and remove a photo.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: Contains application-specific CSS styles.
    -   **Summary of importance**: Defines styling that complements the Tailwind CSS framework, ensuring the dark theme and overall aesthetic are applied consistently across the application.
    -   **Changes made**: Initially written using  to establish the dark theme and design elements as per the user's request.
-   **/app/frontend/src/index.css**: Global Tailwind CSS imports and base styles.
    -   **Summary of importance**: Sets up the foundational Tailwind CSS layers and defines custom CSS variables for color palettes, including light and dark modes, and  for components, essential for the Shadcn UI theme.
    -   **Changes made**: Pre-existing file, not directly modified by the AI engineer in the trajectory, but crucial for the overall styling.
-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**: Lists Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Summary of importance**: Ensures all necessary Python libraries (like FastAPI, , , ) are installed for the backend to function.
    -   **Changes made**:  was added to this file after  was created, and then installed.
-   **/app/frontend/.env & /app/backend/.env**: Environment variable files.
    -   **Summary of importance**: Store sensitive or configuration-dependent variables like  (for frontend to call backend) and  (for backend to connect to database). These are protected and not to be hardcoded.
    -   **Changes made**: Not explicitly shown as modified, but their existence and usage rules are critical for the application's deployment.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Landing Page Redirection:** Redirect start learning button to student sign-up and teach here button to teacher sign-up.
-   **Landing Page UI:** Remove the photo from the landing page.
-   **Spark ETL:** Implementation for batch ingestion of CSVs and JSONs (part of original requirements, not yet addressed).
-   **PostgreSQL Integration:** Current term data storage in PostgreSQL (original requirement, MongoDB currently used).
-   **Full Dashboard Functionalities:** All detailed student/teacher page functionalities (e.g., D3.js charts, PDF download, course catalog, attendance marking, communication tools beyond basic display).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully built the core MVP of the Academic Analytics Portal. The application features a functional landing page with a dark UI, where users can log in as either a student or a teacher. The backend, built with FastAPI, handles user authentication, role-based access control, and serves data from a MongoDB database.

The following key functionalities are implemented and tested:
1.  **Landing Page:** Renders correctly with a dark theme and images.
2.  **Authentication:** Users can log in as a pre-defined student or teacher. Role-based access control is enforced, ensuring students cannot access teacher dashboards and vice-versa.
3.  **Data Seeding:** A dedicated script () was used to populate the MongoDB database with comprehensive sample data for courses, students, teachers, enrollments, grades, assignments, and attendance records.
4.  **Dashboards:** Both student and teacher dashboards are accessible after successful login and display the populated sample data, making them ready for demo. Screenshots confirm their visual readiness and data display.

The last completed action was verifying the teacher dashboard populated with data. The AI engineer was about to provide a summary when the user issued new instructions regarding landing page button redirections and removal of an image, which an edit was then performed for, but not re-tested or confirmed.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the landing page button redirections and photo removal, ensuring they function as per the latest user request.
